**Welcome Pioneer, to the Platform Expansion Program.**  

The **Platform Expansion Program** replaces natural resource deposits and exploration with a tightly focused, efficiency-driven challenge. Instead of roaming for nodes, you’ll build and place **deployable resource nodes**, expanding your platform piece by piece to maximize output under extreme resource constraints.


**Your goal:**  
Expand, optimize, and push your factory to the limits while balancing limited space and escalating demands. Every milestone unlocks new technologies to grow your platform and automate production, culminating in a fully self-sustaining factory suspended in the sky.

## **Core Features**
- **Buildable Resource Nodes:**  
  Replace natural resource deposits with placeable nodes for every resource type.
- **Extreme Resource Constraints:**  
  Begin with minimal resources and slowly scale through careful planning.
- **Science Capsules & Awesome Points:**  
  Create science capsules for a secondary progression path that rewards efficiency.
- **Integrated Liquids System:**  
  Water and oil are generated through alternate production methods.
- **No Dependencies:**  
  This is a standalone experience—no other mods required.

## **Why PEP?**
PEP challenges you to rethink everything you know about Satisfactory. With no sprawling landscapes or creatures to explore, every decision happens on your platform. It’s factory building distilled to its purest form.
